			<h1>The Settings menu</h1>
			<h4>
				The Settings menu allows you to select database options, replace the &quot;Home&quot; tab 
				main image, select your MMS options, configure your Internet services and change screen languages.
			</h4>
			
			<div class="left_aligned_image"><img src="img/settingsmenu.jpg"/></div>
			
			<h2>Database Settings</h2>
			<h3>
				Only under very unusual circumstances should you need to go into the
				<span class="feature">Database Settings</span>
				menu (for example, to rename the database if you're running two copies of 
				FrontlineSMS on the same machine). It is recommended that only system 
				administrators make any changes to the database.
			</h3>
			
			
			<h2>Home Tab Logo Settings</h2>
			<h3>
				If you want to customise the &quot;Home&quot; screen in FrontlineSMS to display your own logo or organisation 
				name, you can replace the main &quot;\o/&quot; image with one of your own, or remove 
				it altogether. When you start FrontlineSMS for the first time, there is no 
				image displayed. To display the default &quot;\o/&quot; logo, select &quot;Use default&quot;.
				
				<span class="note">
					Because of the smaller screen sizes on some of the lower-cost netbooks and laptops, you may need 
					to remove the image altogether in order to see the whole screen.
				</span>
			</h3>
			
			<h2>E-mail Settings</h2>
			<h3>
				FrontlineSMS is able to turn incoming text messages into emails (see the 'Email' <span class="emphase">Keyword Action</span> 
				on the <a href="keywords.htm">Keywords</a> help page). In order for FrontlineSMS to do this, it needs access to a 
				registered email account. This is set up in the <span class="feature">Email Settings</span> screen 
				(you may have to refer to your email provider to obtain the necessary settings).
			</h3>
			
			<h2>MMS Settings</h2>
			<h3>
				From version <span class="highlight">1.6.15</span>, FrontlineSMS comes with a new <span class="feature">Multimedia Messages</span>
				(MMS) compatibility. For now, you can receive MMS sent to an e-mail address (MMS sent to the connected device is not supported yet).
				To do so, just configure your e-mail accounts, and the fetching frequency (see below), and FrontlineSMS will look for MMS in your inbox.
	
				<p>Read more about MMS on the <a href="mms.htm">Multimedia Messages help page</a>.</p>
				
				<div class="left_aligned_image"><img src="img/mms_settings.jpg"/></div>
				
				<span class="note">
					Every carrier formats MMS email content differently, so although MMS from most networks should work without trouble, some may not.
					If you are finding messages are not processed, or contain incorrect information, please forward the offending emails
					to us and we will endeavour to add support in the next release.
				</span>
			</h3>
				
			<h2>SMS Internet Service Settings</h2>
			<h3>
				Although FrontlineSMS was originally developed to allow group text messaging in places where there 
				wasn't internet access, more recent versions allow messages to be sent 
				through the internet if and when it is available. Messages sent this way 
				are generally much faster and cheaper than sending through an attached 
				mobile phone or modem, but you do need to set up an account and buy messages 
				up-front using a credit card. Check the <a href="internetservices.htm">Internet Services help page</a> to learn
				more about <span class="feature">Internet Services</a> in FrontlineSMS.
			</h3>
			
			<h2>Language</h2>
			<h3>
				FrontlineSMS currently comes with language support for English, Arabic, Azerbaijani, Bengali, 
				German, Spanish, Finnish, French, Hindi, Indonesian, Khmer, Portuguese, 
				Russian, Swahili and Chinese. Selecting one of these languages from the <span class="feature">Language</span>
				menu will turn all menu's and screen messages from the default English 
				into the chosen language.
				<span class="tip">
					Languages such as Chinese will only display correctly if your computer supports the 
					additional character sets required. If the typeface displays as square 
					blocks on the screen then your computer does not have the correct font. Refer to your Windows user manual for 
					details.
