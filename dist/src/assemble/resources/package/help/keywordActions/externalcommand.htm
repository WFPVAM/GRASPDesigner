			The <span class="feature">External Command</span> screen is where you tell FrontlineSMS to run another program on your 
			computer, execute a set of commands, or send incoming messages over the 
			internet to a web server whenever a text message containing a 
			pre-determined Keyword is received. Please note that this is advanced 
			functionality and you will likely need technical skills to make any use of 
			it.
			
			<ul>
				<li>HTTP Request</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						If you have an internet connection, FrontlineSMS can automatically send incoming messages over the 
						internet to a web server (this is the functionality used by many 
						<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ushahidi.com">Ushahidi</a> deployments). 
						This can be useful in a number of ways. For example, it can be helpful if you want to back-up messages off-site in 
						case of data loss. Or, if you're running a campaign and want to display SMS feedback from supporters on the homepage 
						of your website, FrontlineSMS can 'pass' this information on (although your web developer will need to 
						write a script to 'listen out' for incoming messages). The messages could then be displayed as a scrolling 'ticker'.
					</li>
					<li>
						To set up a <span class="feature">HTTP Request</span>, select the option at the top of the screen. Along the
						<span class="special">Command</span> line, enter the URL (website address) for the server you want to pass 
						incoming messages to. Depending on how you configure the 'listening' 
						server, you can attach certain bits of information to the end of the
						<span class="special">Command</span> by clicking on any of the <span class="feature">Click to include</span>
						buttons, which adds the relevant field names in for you. Once a message 
						has been successfully received by the server, you will most likely get a 
						response confirming its arrival. Again, depending on your remote server, 
						the <span class="special">Response Type</span> will most likely be <span class="highlight">Plain Text</span>.
						You can decide whether or not you want to do anything further (if not, select <span class="special">Do Not Wait For Response</span>) but you 
						can, if you like, send a reply back to the original message sender (or an entire Group), 
						notifying them that their message has been successfully posted to your 
						website, or successfully received. To do this, type your auto-reply 
						message in the <span class="special">Message</span> window and then, if you also decide to send this message to 
						an entire Group, select the Group name from the list in window under the <span class="special">Forward to Group</span>
						tick box.
					</li>
					<li>
						Finally, you can set <span class="highlight">Start</span> and <span class="highlight">End Dates</span> 
						if you only want the <span class="highlight">HTTP Request<span class="highlight"> to be active during a set time period
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="tip">
							You can also insert the response text that you get back from the 
							remote server by clicking the <span class="feature">Include Response</span> button while compiling your message</span>
						</span>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>Command Line Execution</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Software developers and 
						advanced users can write batch files or scripts, and then instruct 
						FrontlineSMS to run them when the pre-determined keyword is detected. 
					</li>
					<li>
						These scripts can be programmed to do pretty-much anything, depending on 
						the programmer. To run an external command, follow the instructions above, 
						selecting <span class="highlight">Command Line Execution</span> from the top menu.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
