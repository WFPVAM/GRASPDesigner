				You need to set up an email account in FrontlineSMS if you want to use 
				this function. Click on &quot;<span class="highlight">E-mail Accounts Settings</span>&quot; and enter the 
				name of your SMTP server, your full email address and your email password. 
				You should have these settings - if not refer to your email provider. You 
				may also want to create a unique email address for FrontlineSMS to use. 
				Successfully added email accounts display in the 'From' window
			</span>
			
			The <span class="feature">E-mail</span> screen allows you to tell FrontlineSMS to automatically forward incoming 
			text messages starting with your pre-determined keyword to an email recipient. On the <span class="highlight">E-mail</span> screen,
			type in the <span class="special">Subject</span> for the email, followed by an email <span class="special">Message</span>
			you can include fields such as <span class="feature">Senders Name</span> and the <span class="feature">Message Content</span>
			within the body of the email message - if you like - by clicking on the relevant <span class="feature">Click to include</span>
			button). Select the email account you want to send the messages through in 
			the <span class="special">From</span> window, and the email address of the person you want the emails to be sent 
			to. Again, you can set <span class="highlight">Start</span> and <span class="highlight">End Dates</span> if you only 
			want the emails to be sent during a set time period.
